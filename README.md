## Overview
The Chatbot using Transformers is a Python-based application that utilizes the power of Transformers models to engage in interactive conversations. It can answer questions, generate responses, and have text-based conversations with users.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Transformers library
- SentencePiece library
- Accelerate library
- PyTorch
- IPython
- Other Python libraries

## Features
- Utilizes state-of-the-art Transformers models for natural language processing.
- Can answer questions and engage in conversations.
- Provides an interactive chat experience.
- Supports user prompts for generating responses.

## Setup
To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install SentencePiece
pip install sentencepiece
pip install accelerate
```

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Adjust the settings in the provided Python script according to your preferences.

4. Run the chatbot application using Python:

```bash
python Chatbot_Stable_Beluga.py
```



## Usage
